I’m excited to share that [React Wheel Picker](https://react-wheel-picker.chanhdai.com), an open source project built by the community, has been selected to join the [▲Vercel OSS Program](https://vercel.com/blog/summer-2025-oss-program#react-wheel-picker) summer 2025 cohort.

React Wheel Picker is a lightweight, customizable, and touch-friendly picker component for React — built to deliver a smooth, native-like scrolling experience across modern browsers. It started as a side project by its creator, and it’s been amazing to see it grow with the help of contributors and feedback from users.

As part of the Vercel OSS Program, the project will receive $300/month in infrastructure credits for the next 12 months, along with support from the developer community. This support is a big motivation for its maintainers to keep improving the project and pushing it forward.

If you’re curious, feel free to explore the demo or check out the source code:
