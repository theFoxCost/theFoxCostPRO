  about: `
Hi, I’m Mohamed Mossab — a self-taught Electrical Engineer and passionate creator who loves bringing ideas to life through code, design, and electronics.  

I enjoy working on projects that mix creativity with technology, whether it’s building intuitive web apps, experimenting with IoT & networking, or designing in CAD. Over the years, I’ve taught myself everything from cybersecurity to full-stack development — always learning, always building.  

I believe small details make the biggest difference, and that’s what drives me to keep improving my craft. When I’m not coding, I like tinkering with electronics, exploring new tools, and working on personal projects that challenge me to think differently.  

Besides tech, I also enjoy learning and connecting with people in different languages. I speak **Arabic, French, English, Chinese, and German**, which helps me discover new cultures and perspectives.  

Let’s connect and create something awesome together!
